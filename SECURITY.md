# Security Policy

One of our biggest goals is the security of MUMATHS. User's privacy is protected at all costs. If you found a security issue or vulnerability, no matter how critical it is, please report it to us immediately and we will get it fixed as soon as possible. 

## Older Versions

We don't update MUMATHS v<3 anymore since those versions are only accessible through [Archive](https://tinagrit.github.io/archive/maths/). Archive users should be aware of XSS or other potential threats.

## Not security related

If you found a bug or would like to create a request which is not security related, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/tinagrit/mumaths/issues).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report it to our email [webmasters@tinagrit.com](mailto:webmasters@tinagrit.com) with the security issue as detailed as possible. Expect a reply within 3 business days and please whitelist the domain *tinagrit.com* or email *webmasters@tinagrit.com* to ensure you can receive our messages.
