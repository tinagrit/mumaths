# MUMATHS _**BETA**_
is a minimal web app/game allowing users to practice mental math calculation. You choose how you want to see it yourself by choosing fonts, themes, positions. Make it your own! You'll find yourself more focused in a comfortable environment and perhaps do a faster and more accurate calculation.

We are heavily inspired by [Monkeytype](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype). Thanks to [Miodec](https://github.com/miodec) and all of its contributors!

### Technologies
- We don't practically implement any backends at the moment. Our server uses [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) to serve HTML.
- We run on just HTML, CSS and frontend JavaScript. We're trying to keep our web app framework free.
- For smooth experience, we implemented SPA to the website. The main router is located at [mumaths/static/js/router.js](https://github.com/tinagrit/mumaths/blob/main/static/js/router.js).
- Icons are from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). See credit in [mumaths/static/assets/dataset.js](https://github.com/tinagrit/mumaths/blob/main/static/assets/dataset.js).
- Developed on Google Chrome, made sure it works on Safari. Other browsers not guaranteed to work.

### Gamemodes
1. **Calculation**
    - **Operations + - x /** Based on the operation you choose, the game will give you two random numbers to do the calculation. You have the option to turn negative answer off/on on subtraction mode.
    - **Shuffle** The game will randomly select an operation and two numbers and you calculate them.
2. **24 Game** 
    - Practice quick calculation and problem solving. The game will give you four numbers. You need to use the operations buttons to make the numbers 24.  
3. **Formula**
    - Formulae are essential to perform certain mathematical calculations, and you need to remember some of them. Based on a topic you choose, it will either ask you to complete the formula or ask you what the variables mean.
4. **Factor**
    - Sometimes factoring is the key to the solution. The game will give you an expression and you need to answer the completely factored expression that equals to the question.
5. **Memory**
    - A benchmark for how much you can remember. Simple. The game will give you a sequence and you need to follow it.
___
**Game stops when**
- **Question** The game will end when the specified number of questions is completed
- **Time** The game will keep going within a specific timeframe
- **Infinity** The game will not stop until you hit stop
