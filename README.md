# MUMATHS _**BETA**_
is a minimal web app/game allowing users to practice mental math calculation. You choose how you want to see it yourself by choosing fonts, themes, positions. Make it your own! You'll find yourself more focused in a comfortable environment and perhaps do a faster and more accurate calculation.

We are heavily inspired by [Monkeytype](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype). Thanks to [Miodec](https://github.com/miodec) and all of its contributors!

### Technologies
- We don't practically implement any backends at the moment. Our server uses [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) to serve HTML.
- We run on just HTML, CSS and frontend JavaScript. We're trying to keep our web app framework free.
- Icons are from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). See credit in [mumaths/assets/dataset.js](https://github.com/tinagrit/mumaths/blob/main/assets/dataset.js).
- Developed on Google Chrome, made sure it works on Safari. Other browsers not guaranteed to work.
